# Music Launchpad :notes:	

## What is this project? :bulb:

Based on an electronic music launchpad, this app mainly relies on CSS and React. Each of the nine pad buttons are a single multi instantiated component, each mapped with its own keyboard key and sound. In addition to that, it has a volume control and a functional screen. Uses hooks, event handling, objects and arrays.
